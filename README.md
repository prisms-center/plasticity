<B>What is PRISMS-Plasticity?</B>

  PRISMS-Plasticity is a Finite Element Method (FEM) code for solving boundary value
  problems arising in <B>Continuum Plasticity</B> and <B>Crystal Plasticity</B>.
  It is build on top of the deal.II open source finite element
  library [http://www.dealii.org]

  This code is developed by the PRedictive Integrated Structural
  Materials Science (PRISMS) Center [http://www.prisms-center.org/]
  at University of Michigan which is supported by the U.S. Department
  of Energy (DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences
  and Engineering under Award #DE-SC0008637

<B>Installation:</B>
  Refer to the installation manual in docs/installation manual.pdf for detailed instructions on getting started with using the plasticity code.

  you need to compile deal.ii without trilinos package. To do that, if you're using candi, you can turn it off in candi.cfg by commenting that as #PACKAGES="${PACKAGES} once:trilinos". With deal.ii installed and $DEAL_II_DIR setup, the following steps can be followed to download and compile the code.

  1. Clone the PRISMS Plasticity GitHub repo https://github.com/prisms-center/plasticity<br>
  + $ git clone https://github.com/prisms-center/plasticity.git <br>
  and <br>
  + $ cd plasticity <br>


  2. Compile the library
  + $ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <br>
  For optimized mode:<br>
  + $ cmake CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <br>
  + $ make -jN <br>
  + $ export PLAS_DIR=$PWD <br>
  Here N refers to number of processor cores available, this helps in quicker compilation. <br>

  3. Compile plasticity applications
  + $ cd applications/crystalPlasticity <br>
  + $ cmake . <br>
  + $ make <br>

<B>Running an example simulation</B>
  + $ cd applications/crystalPlasticity/fcc/simpleTension <br>
  Execution (parallel runs): <br>
  + $ mpirun -np nprocs $PLAS_DIR/applications/crystalPlasticity/main prm.in<br>
  [here nprocs denotes the number of processors]

  Updates: Since plasticity code is still under active development,
  regular code and documentation updates are pushed to the upstream
  repo (https://github.com/prisms-center/plasticity) and we strongly
  recommend users to synchronize their respective clones/forks at regular
  intervals or when requested by the developers through the
  announcements on the mailing list.

<B>Visualization</B>

  Output of the primal fields and postprocessed fields is in standard vtk
  format (parallel:*.pvtu, serial:*.vtu files) which can be visualized with the
  following open source applications:
  1. VisIt (https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/downloads)
  2. Paraview (http://www.paraview.org/download/)

<B>Getting started:</B>

  Examples of various boundary value problems are located under the
  applications/ folder. Easiest way to get started on the code is to
  run the applications.

  Applications are intended to serve as (1) Demonstration of the
  capabilities of this library, (2) Provide a framework for
  further development of specialized/advanced applications by
  users.

  Application or code under development/testing is preceded by an
  underscore.

  List of folders:
  + src/: material models (continuum plasticity and crystal plasticity),
  ellipticBVP (base class for parallel implementation of elliptic
  boundary value problems), enrichment models (enhanced strain),
  utility (static condensation class, crystal orientations and grain
  information IO)
  + applications/: continuum plasticity and crystal plasticity
  + utils/: IntegrationTools (developed by the PRISMS center and available at
  https://github.com/prisms-center/IntegrationTools) and json headers
  + docs/: Installation Manual, User manual, and User defined material model manual
  + Training_Materials/: Instructions for using preprocessing tools, such as generating input files, and postprocessing tools, such as visualizing the outputs
  + html/: HTML documentation generated by doxygen

<B>Documentation:</B>

  Detailed Installation Manual, User manual, and User defined material model manual are provided in /doc/ folder.
